Context:
I want to complete a code challenge. The code challenge is about JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string. For Example, if I input 'AI4Devs', it should return 'sveD4IA'
Results:
I need an HTML code to interact with the user. The user will input a string and click a button called "Reverse" that triggers JS logic to reverse the string and then display the reversed string. This code might be in the index.html file. â€¢ I need JS logic to reverse the string coming from HTML; this logic might be in the script.js file.
