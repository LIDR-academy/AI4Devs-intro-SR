# Prompt 1

Imagine that you're master frontend developer and needs to create a small view with an input, a button called Reverse, another button called Copy, checkbox called Automatic Mode and a list of string. where if you write "AI4Devs" in the input and click in Reverse button it should return "sveD4IA" and show it in the list... if you click in Copy button should save the reverse string into clipboard

You can use basic design for this

Important points:
- Its need to use only index.html and script.js files
- Not save the list into localStorage
- If Automatic Mode is checked, the string is inverted in realtime but not saved in the list only when the user clicked in Copy button


# Prompt 2 - Doesnt works!
it works! but... I would like to see the inverse word in the input when the user is typing and Automatic mode is checked

- Fix: In the next prompt I request add a debounce

# Prompt 3
well, I like... can you add some debounce to be sure the user finish typing?
